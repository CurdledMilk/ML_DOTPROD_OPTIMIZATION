Compares 4 algorithms for dot product:

1. Klutzy's naive for loop algorithm
2. Klutzy's naive for loop with conditional algorithm
3. marr75's vectorized algorithm
4. marr75's sparse matrix vectorized algorithm

In a sample run for a 5000x5000 matrix:
1. Elapsed: 2.33s, Naive Loop Algorithm
2. Elapsed: 1.16s, Naive Loop w/ Skip Algorithm
3. Elapsed: 587.05ms, Vectorized Algorithm
4. Elapsed: 509.66ms, Sparse Matrix Algorithm


and it also runs my superier algorith lmao
