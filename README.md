Compares 4 algorithms for dot product:

1. Klutzy's naive for loop algorithm
2. Klutzy's naive for loop with conditional algorithm
3. marr75's vectorized algorithm
4. marr75's sparse matrix vectorized algorithm
5. Klutzy's naive for loop with conditional algorithm (again)

In a sample run for a 5000x5000 matrix:
Elapsed: 1.61s, Naive Loop Algorithm
Elapsed: 809.08ms, Naive Loop w/ Skip Algorithm
Elapsed: 967.55ms, Vectorized Algorithm
Elapsed: 463.42ms, Sparse Matrix Algorithm
Elapsed: 808.02ms, THIS IS my old ALGO before some guy ruined it
